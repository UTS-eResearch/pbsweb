## Introduction

This small web application provides a simple web view of the nodes, queues and jobs 
on a High Performance Computer Cluster running the PBS batch scheduling system.
It was developed using PBS Professional but should also work with the open source PBS.
General information on PBS can be found at its Wikipedia entry 
[Portable Batch System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Batch_System) and the 
[PBS Professional Open Source Project](https://www.pbspro.org) homepage.
This project is hosted at the eResearch site at Github <https://github.com/UTS-eResearch/pbsweb>
